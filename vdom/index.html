# The Details
* On *one* platform (Android) we had very poor performance
* We noticed it *years* ago, and despite it Discourse's success continued
* We made small tweaks such as rendering fewer items to buy us time
---
# Efforts to Fix
* We blogged about it
* We created the [ember-performance](https://github.com/eviltrout/ember-performance) suite and render performance tabs on the Ember Inspector
* We raised issues with v8 and Ember

# What was slow? Our "Hot Path"
* A post stream is an infinitely scrolling list of posts
  * A post has a 15+ controls
  * A post has a list of links
* This could easily be 400+ components to initially render
  on large topics with more added as you scroll
---
# Under the Hood: The Object Model
* Each component is an `Ember.Object`
* `Ember.Object` supports bound data, computed properties and observers
* These are awesome features (okay maybe not observers) but they come
  at a cost
* The more bound data you have, the more work Ember has to
  do to wire up updates and the slower it goes

# Discourse World Tour 2015

---
# Crazy Idea
* What if we knew our exact data flow and when rerendering needed to happen?
* That's where having 4+ years on one project really helps!
* We could trade flexibility and ease of coding for speed
---
# Discourse Widgets
* A lightweight wrapper on the excellent [virtual-dom](https://github.com/Matt-Esch/virtual-dom) library
* Less than 300 LOC
* Replaces Handlebars templates with ES2015 classes
* Bubbles actions up into Ember
* Leverages the Ember run loop for coalescing and scheduling updates
---
# Major Downside: Uglier and Harder to write

Handlebars
```handlebars
<div class='post'>
  <div class='post-body'>
    {{post.body}}
  </div>
</div>
```

Discourse Widget
```javascript
import { h } from 'virtual-dom';

createWidget('post', {
  tagName: 'div.post',
  html(attrs) {
    return h('div.post-body', attrs.body);
  }
});
```
---
# Other Downsides
* Larger code base than compiled templates
* Not idiomatic Ember
* You have to call `this.scheduleRenrender()` sometimes
* Took 6+ weeks of Development

# Huge Upside: 5x Performance!

# Often 8x faster on Android!

---
# Integration
* Leverages Ember Components
* A useful way to wrap jQuery or VanillaJS code
* Also allows us to do whatever we want with the DOM in a sandbox
---
# DOM Lifecycle Triggers

```javascript
export Ember.Component.extend({
  didInsertElement() {
    // start up custom rendering using this.element
  }

  willDestroyElement() {
    // tear down custom rendering
  }
});
```
---
# Integration

Embedding a Discourse Widget:

```handlebars
{{mount-widget widget="post-gutter" args=links}}
```
---
# Testable

```javascript
widgetTest("collapsed links", {
  template: '{{mount-widget widget="post-gutter" args=args}}',
  setup() {
    this.set('args', {
      links: [
        { title: "Link 1", url: "http://eviltrout.com?1" },
        { title: "Link 2", url: "http://eviltrout.com?2" },
        { title: "Link 3", url: "http://eviltrout.com?3" },
        { title: "Link 4", url: "http://eviltrout.com?4" },
        { title: "Link 5", url: "http://eviltrout.com?5" },
        { title: "Link 6", url: "http://eviltrout.com?6" },
        { title: "Link 7", url: "http://eviltrout.com?7" },
      ]
    });
  },
  test(assert) {
    assert.equal(this.$('.post-links a.track-link').length, 5);
    click('a.toggle-more');
    andThen(() => {
      assert.equal(this.$('.post-links a.track-link').length, 7);
    });
  }
});
```

# Ember's Future: Glimmer v2.0

* Glimmer 2.0 should benefit Discourse in the majority of our code
  that still uses Handlebars

* Discourse Widgets are in the latest stable Discourse *today*.
  We didn't have to wait for Glimmer 2.0 to be finished

* I suspect that even if we'd waited it wouldn't be as fast as our
  precisely tuned renderer...
---
# @wycats Disagrees!

* wycats suspects that Glimmer 2.0 can be faster because
  it is a VM for rendering and can be even smarter about what
  to rerender

* wycats wants to understand Discourse's hot path to make sure
  that Glimmer can support it. I'm going to do a deep dive
  with him soon

---
# Being Wrong is Awesome!

* I would *love* to be wrong about this. I would be more than happy
  to eat crow and go back to Glimmer if it's indeed faster

* Definitely watch Yehuda Katz and Goddfrey Chan's talk from
  EmberConf 2016 about rendering when it is posted!

---
# Should you do what Discourse Did?

* Probably not, unless:

 * Your app is mature, has a hot path, and you know exactly how
   it needs to work

 * You have measuredly slow performance on Android and it
   matters to you

 * You are comfortable spending many weeks re-writing your
   handlebars templates, likely introducing regressions in the
   process
---
# Post-Morterm

* The re-write has been a tremendous success for us

* It's been deployed to all our customers, and now that it's
  in the stable channel it will be released to many more
  Discourse installs

* There are thousands of active Discourse deployments, with
  millions of users. Android is no longer a second class citizen
