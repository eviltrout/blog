## Discourse: The Tech Stack

* Back end is Ruby on Rails, Redis, Postgres

* Front end is Ember.js (Babel ES)
  * Been running Ember.js before it was 1.0!

* We ship Docker Containers for production

## Potential Customer: "Do you have a styleguide?"

---

<div class='right-images'>

</div>

## Me: "..."
---
## Excuses!

* We didn't know what we were building when we started

* The design and components were changed a lot in the first
  two years

* Initially, Discourse could not be styled without forking it!
---
## Growing Up

* We simplified our HTML/CSS a lot to make styling easier

* We beefed up the customization tools and added support for
  plugins.

* We moved more of our application to use Ember Components
  to encourage re-use and composition

# The Next Step: A Living Styleguide

<div class='right-images'>
  <img src="./images/fabricator.png" style="margin-top: 2.5em">
</div>

## Fabricator

* A customer of ours had experience with Fabricator

* It seemed like a cool tool, but had some downsides

  * Minor: Node based toolchain that wouldn't fit easily into
    our development environment

  * Major: Getting our HTML/CSS into Fabricator was very
    difficult
---
<div class='right-images'>
  <img src="./images/fabricator.png" style="margin-top: 2.5em">
</div>

## Fabricator (continued)

* The workflow involved copying and pasting HTML into
  Fabricator, styling it, then exporting styles back to
  Discourse

* It seemed Fabricator and atomic design is much harder
  to fit into an existing application than starting fresh

## What if we just integrated a styleguide directly into Discourse?
---
## The "Not Invented Here" Trap

1. Is this necessary, or do I just want to implement it for fun?

2. How much work are we really talking about here?
---
## Is this necessary?

* Copying and pasting HTML is tedious

* HTML is frequently getting out of sync as we make structural
  changes

* Designers could live with the workflow, but it's going to
  involve a lot more chatter

---
## How much work?

* My gut feeling is no more than 1 day of work to get a
  plugin working as a styleguide

* My gut feeling is frequently wrong <img src="./images/sad.png" class="emoji">
---
## Risks / Reward

* What if it was timeboxed?

* Spend one day of work on it. If it pans out, it means
  front end people will spend much less time in the long
  run

* If it takes longer than a day, junk it

## Let's do this!
<img src="./images/letsdothis.png" class='reasonable-size'>
---
## Ember.js

<div class='right-images' style="margin-top: 1.5em">
  <img src="./images/ember.png">
</div>

* Ember doesn't get as much attention these days as React
  or Vue.js or (insert next big thing)

* It brings a *lot* to the table:

  * A robust, stateful and hierarchical router

  * Component support with full Javascript lifecycle

  * Handlebars templates for simple and powerful templates

  * An opinionated, convention-over-configuration structure
---
## The power of leverage
<div class='right-images' style="margin-top: 1.5em">
  <img src="./images/ember.png">
</div>

* Simplicity is a trap

* Ember includes a lot of things because you're probably going
  to need them

* Discourse uses almost every feature Ember provides, which is
  a great argument for a "big toolbox" framework
---
class: indent-code

## Leverage - Convention over Configuration

* We don't want to have to add a new route every time someone adds
  a new example to the styleguide

* Let's copy how Ember does it and discover files in our application
  based on their paths

* Ideally, you'd just drop a handlebars template in a folder and the
  styleguide would find it:

```
styleguide/
  atoms/
    button.hbs
    headings.hbs
  molecules/
    post-menu.hbs
    bread-crumbs.hbs
  organisms/
    post.hbs
    topic-list.hbs
```
---
## What's in a path?

Given `styleguide/atoms/button.bhs`

* We can extract the example's category `atoms`

* We can extract the example's name `button`

---
# Ember makes it easy

* It exposes a list of all your templates `Ember.TEMPLATES`

* When displaying the menu, we can enumerate all the templates found
  and even translate keys (`button`) using I18n support

* The menu can link to an example, which is just the template we have defined
---
# Example: buttons.hbs

```hbs
{{#styleguide-example title="icon"}}
  {{d-button icon="smile-o"}}
{{/styleguide-example}}

{{#styleguide-example title="text"}}
  {{d-button label="topic.create"}}
{{/styleguide-example}}

{{#styleguide-example title="icon + text"}}
  {{d-button icon="plus" label="topic.create"}}
{{/styleguide-example}}
```

* `styleguide-example` wraps an example for display

* `{{d-button}}` is a component from Discourse that we want to render

---
# That's pretty much it!

<img src="./images/old-screenshot.png" class='reasonable-size'>
---
# Time spent

* It took less than a day to get the discourse plugin working
  with a few examples and the designers were off to the races

* Open sourced it right away as `discourse-styleguide`
  (https://github.com/discourse/discourse-styleguide)

* First release was ~70 SLOC (Ruby + JS)

---
# Enhancements

* We added many more examples as we styled them. Adding a
  new example was as simple as adding a new file + a
  translation key

* Other plugins could add examples and they magically worked,
  because `discourse-styleguide` was just looking for
  templates in a `styleguide` directory

* We added the ability to create dummy data via JS. You can use
  the dummy data for your components to render various Discourse
  elements like topics and posts

---
# Note support

* Designers wanted the ability to leave notes in the guide

* Convention over configuration strikes again!

* A template in `notes` folder is automatically rendered in
  the section with the same name

# Current Version Screenshot

---
# Conclusion

* We now have a living styleguide, integrated into our application

* Designers love it when theming Discourse

* Plugins love it because they can extend it and create even more
  elaborate components and styles

* It took very little time to build, thanks to Ember!

# ember-freestyle

<img src="./images/ember-freestyle.png" class='max-size'>
---
class: indent-code

# ember-freestyle

* From Luke Melia + Chris LoPresto

* Remarkably similar to `discourse-styleguide`

```hbs
{{#freestyle-guide title="My Living Style Guide"}}
  {{#freestyle-section name="UI Elements"}}
    {{#freestyle-usage "loading-spinner" title="Loading Spinner"}}
      {{loading-spinner}}
    {{/freestyle-usage}}
  {{/freestyle-section}}
{{/freestyle-guide}}
```

* Doesn't do autodiscovery of files, you append to one template

* Wouldn't have worked for Discourse due to plugin support

* You should probably use it if you're not Discourse!
