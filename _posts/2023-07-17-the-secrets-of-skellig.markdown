I've wanted to dip my feet back into game development for a while, and last year I decided to put my money where my
mouth is. I resigned from my full time job at Discourse and pulled up a bunch of YouTube tutorials on Blender and Godot.

It's been a ridiculous amount of fun, and I've learned so much about how modern 3D games are made. I'm finally ready to
announce what I've been working on. It's a puzzle game, inspired by crosswords, called "The Secrets of Skellig."

The road ahead is long, and I have a lot more work to do. I'm making it primarily myself at this point, so it'll be slow
going but I'm making excellent progress.
