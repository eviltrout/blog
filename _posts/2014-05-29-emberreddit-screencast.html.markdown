One of my more popular blog entries is on [using Ember.js without Ember Data](https://eviltrout.com/2013/03/23/ember-without-data.html).
Recently I've been going through my old entries and making sure they don't have any glaring mistakes,
and I realized this would be a good opportunity to convert my [emberreddit](https://github.com/eviltrout/emberreddit)
project to [ember-cli](http://iamstef.net/ember-cli/).

This screencast shows how you can build an Ember.js application without using Ember Data. It starts off simple and then shows how to build advanced stuff like an identity map yourself.

It assumes some knowledge of Ember. The guides and docs for Ember.js are available at:
[http://emberjs.com/guides/](http://emberjs.com/guides/)

To install NodeJS go to:
[http://nodejs.org/](http://nodejs.org/)

The excellent ember-cli is available at:
[http://iamstef.net/ember-cli/](http://iamstef.net/ember-cli/)

And finally the code created in this screencast can be found here:

Thanks to Stefan Penner, Jo Liss and the Ember Core team for making this amazing framework and tools. Also thanks to Erik Bryn for showing me a few tips about the model hook!

I had a lot of fun making the screencast so I will likely do more in the future. Drop me a line and let me know what
future screencasts you'd like to see.
