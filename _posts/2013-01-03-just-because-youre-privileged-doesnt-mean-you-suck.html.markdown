title: Just because you're privileged doesn't mean you suck
date: 2013-01-03

Recently, I wrote a short essay on [privilege and programming](https://eviltrout.com/2012/12/30/programming-since-i-was-seven.html). It was quite popular on [/r/programming](http://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/15ojq6/ive_been_programming_since_i_was_7/) and generated hundreds of comments, both there and on this blog. 

I was surprised and flattered to see the majority of the comments agreed with my post, however a few people brought up a concern which I'd like to address:

> Why this is person trying to convince me that I should regretful for being able to use a computer at a young age just because others couldn't?

This is a very common misconception about privilege. 

Being privileged doesn't stop you from being awesome. For example, one of my favorite films of all time is *[Lost in Translation](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0335266/)*. It was directed by [Sophia Coppola](http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001068/), the daughter of the director of *The Godfather*, [Francis Ford Coppola](http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000338/). I don't think it's wrong to assume that, had she not been his daughter, there is very little chance that *Lost in Translation* would exist. Not only did her father fund it, but he raised her in the world of cinema, allowing her to absorb how it worked from a very early age. By the time she started directing movies, she had a huge head start.

Does being privileged mean that Sofia Coppola is somehow a worse director than if she had a different father? Of course not. Her work stands on its own.

I would *never* suggest that you shouldn't take advantage of the opportunities you've been afforded. My parents worked very hard so that I could have the access to computers at a young age. It would have been rude to throw all that away. 

Having access to a computer is just one way I was privileged. There are countless others: I wasn't raised in poverty, or in a country riddled with disease or corruption. I am a white man and have never faced racism or sexual discrimination. 

I don't feel regret for who I am, I just recognize that not everyone has it so easy. **Privilege is about being mindful of the fact that not all people have equal footing.**

It also an important first step towards correcting injustices, for if you truly believe that everyone has the same opportunities as you, there is no reason to advocate for change.
