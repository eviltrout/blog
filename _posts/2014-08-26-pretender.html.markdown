Recently I fell in love with [Pretender](https://github.com/trek/pretender), the mock server library in
Javascript, so I decided to record a screencast showing how to use it in an Ember.js integration test:

The source code for the login application is [on github](https://github.com/eviltrout/login). The finished
version is in the [pretender branch](https://github.com/eviltrout/login/tree/pretender).
