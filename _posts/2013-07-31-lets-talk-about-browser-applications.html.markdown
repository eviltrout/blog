Back in [February](http://techtalksto.com/post/43572802208/robin-ward-presenting-discourse-ember-js-and-client), I gave
a presentation on Discourse and client side MVC at TechTalksTO.

It wasn't recorded, but I've taken the liberty of creating a video version of the presentation with an audio track.

While the presentation is about Browser Applications, I take a large detour in the beginning to talk about
[Discourse](http://discourse.org) and Forum software in general. Enjoy!
