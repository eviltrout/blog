title: "ember-tv: Creating a 10 foot interface in Ember.js"
date: 2014-11-17

Over the weekend I spoke at the [Embergarten Saturday Symposium](https://unspace.ca/embergarten/), which
was an awesome mini conference on Ember in Toronto. My topic was "Ember at 10ft", and it was about
how to build a TV friendly interface in Ember.js.

The talk was recorded but not yet posted, however I've already posted the [source code](https://github.com/eviltrout/ember-tv)
on github. The github repo contains my slides from the talk as well as speaking notes.

I've also put up an [online demo](http://embertv.eviltrout.com). Check it out!
