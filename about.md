I'm the co-founder of [Discourse](https://discourse.org), the popular open source forum software.

Before that, I created [Forumwarz](https://forumwarz.com), a web game about internet trolling.

I live in Toronto. I like web development, technology, video games and pop culture.

All opinions are my own.
