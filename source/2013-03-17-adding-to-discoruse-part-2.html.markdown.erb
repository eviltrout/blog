### Ember.Js + Client Side MVC

You might have heard Ember.JS described as a *Client-Side MVC Framework*, where MVC refers to "Model-View-Controller."
In the first part of our tutorial, we talked about how Ember.js uses *convention over configuration* to prevent
developers from having to create boilerplate and get up and running quickly.

Previously, we created an `adminReports` resource to handle URLs in the form of `/admin/reports/:type`. Ember
automatically looked for our class called `Discourse.AdminReportsRoute`. However, that's not the only thing
Ember looked for! It will also find `Discourse.AdminReportsController` and use that as our controller
to handle that URL.

You might be thinking: "We never created an `AdminReportsController` though! What's up with that?"

Ember did something very convenient for us. We didn't define a controller, so it couldn't find
one when it wired things up. Instead, it *created one for us* and gave it the default behavior.
And for our purposes the default behavior was enough, so things just worked and we had to write
less code!


### Controllers in Ember.JS

Controllers serve a few major purposes in an Ember.js application.

1. **To respond to user interactions**: When a user interacts with
    a view, say by clicking a button, you need to declare a method that will respond to
    that action.

2. **To expose data to your views**: Usually you will be exposing one model or a
    collection of models to a view. The controller is responsible for making a model's
    data available for display in your template.

3. **To maintain state outside your models**: Sometimes you need to work with data
    that doesn't have anything to do with your models. A good example would if a user
    clicked on a column heading to change the sort order of a table. You could store the
    current sort order in the controller as a property.

If you've used a server side MVC framework such as Rails before, you should know that Ember.js
controllers work a little differently. In server side MVC, controllers lose all
state between requests. If you set an instance variable in one controller method and then
call another in another request, the variable won't be there!

In an Ember.js application such as Discourse, *your controllers stay around*. If you set a
property in a controller, it will be there as long as the controller is still in use.


### The AdminReportsController

How did Ember know what data to expose to our template if we never created a controller?
If you recall, in our AdminReportRoute, we had a method called `model`:

    model: function(params) {
      return(Discourse.Report.find(params.type));
    },

When we entered our route, the `model` function was called and returned a single `Discourse.Report`
object. Ember then inferred that our controller was dealing with a single model (rather than
say, an array of models), and created an
[ObjectController](http://emberjs.com/api/classes/Ember.ObjectController.html) for us.

An `ObjectController` is very simple. It exposes all the properties of your model as properties
on the controller itself. In our template, we were able to say `{{title}}` and the controller
knew to route that property to our model.


### Adding controller functionality

The default behaviors of Ember can last you a while. But what if we wanted to add
a bar chart display of the data in addition to our tabular display? We'll have to define our own
controller to handle that.

Let's create the controller Ember needs and put it in `admin/controllers/admin_reports_controller.js`

    Discourse.AdminReportsController = Ember.ObjectController.extend({
      viewMode: 'table',

      // true if we're viewing the table mode
      viewingTable: function() {
        return this.get('viewMode') === 'table';
      }.property('viewMode'),

      // true if we're viewing the bar chart mode
      viewingBarChart: function() {
        return this.get('viewMode') === 'barChart';
      }.property('viewMode'),

      // Changes the current view mode to 'table'
      viewAsTable: function() {
        this.set('viewMode', 'table');
      },

      // Changes the current view mode to 'barChart'
      viewAsBarChart: function() {
        this.set('viewMode', 'barChart');
      }

    });

Let's do a quick run through. The first thing we do is declare a property called `viewMode` and set
it to be 'table'.

After that, we have two [computed properties](http://emberjs.com/guides/object-model/computed-properties/),
`viewingTable` and `viewingBarChart`. As you can see, their implementation is very easy. They return
booleans depending on the current view mode. The reason we do this is because handlebars is designed to
be stupidly simple, so its `#if` statements can only respond to true or false values.

Finally, we have two methods, `viewAsTable` and `viewAsBarChart` that will be called when the user hits
the buttons in the template.

### A quick update to the model

In order to display a bar chart, we'll need to add a `percentage` property to each row of data in our
report. This is easily done in our `find` method.

    Discourse.Report = Discourse.Model.extend({});

    Discourse.Report.reopenClass({
      find: function(type) {
        var model = Discourse.Report.create({type: type});
        $.ajax("/admin/reports/" + type, {
          type: 'GET',
          success: function(json) {

            // Add a percent field to each tuple
            var maxY = 0;
            json.report.data.forEach(function (row) {
              if (row.y > maxY) maxY = row.y;
            })
            if (maxY > 0) {
              json.report.data.forEach(function (row) {
                row.percentage = Math.round((row.y / maxY) * 100);
              })
            }

            model.mergeAttributes(json.report);
            model.set('loaded', true);
          }
        });
        return(model);
      }
    });

All we're doing here is figuring out the maximum `y` property, and then updating each report object
to have a `percetage` field which is their `y` divided by the maximum.


Finally, let's set up our template:

    {{#if loaded}}
      <h3>{{title}}</h3>

      <button class='btn'
              {{action viewAsTable}}
              {{bindAttr disabled="viewingTable"}}>View as Table</button>

      <button class='btn'
              {{action viewAsBarChart}}
              {{bindAttr disabled="viewingBarChart"}}>View as Bar Chart</button>

      <table class='table report'>
        <tr>
          <th>{{xaxis}}</th>
          <th>{{yaxis}}</th>
        </tr>

        {{#each data}}
          <tr>
            <td>{{x}}</td>
            <td>
              {{#if controller.viewingTable}}
                {{y}}
              {{/if}}
              {{#if controller.viewingBarChart}}
                <div class='bar-container'>
                  <div class='bar' style="width: {{unbound percentage}}%">{{y}}</div>
                </div>
              {{/if}}
            </td>
          </tr>
        {{/each}}
      </table>

    {{else}}
      {{i18n loading}}
    {{/if}}

Near the top, you can see there are two `<button>` tags for switching the mode. The `{{action}}`
helper wires things up so that when the user interacts with that button, the appropraite method
on the controller will be called.

The next helper, `{{bindAttr}}` allows you to bind an HTML attribute to a property. In this case,
we've bound the `disabled` property of the button tag to the *opposite* viewMode than the
button represents. By doing this, the buttons will automatically enable and disable depending
on the current state.

### Try it out!

If you open up `/admin/reports/active` you'll now see an interface that allows you to switch
between views at the touch a button.

<%= image_tag 'posts/bar-graph.png', class: 'screenshot', alt: 'Visits by Day' %>

Think about all the code we *didn't* have to write to make this work.

* We have separated our concerns. We have a simple template that a front end designer can modify
  easily. The controllers and models are cleanly set apart.
* Our code loads data asyncronously and only displays it when it is ready.
* The user can switch the view style without having to contact the server for the data again.

In the next installment of this series, I plan to show how to create a custom view and the advantages
it can give us!
